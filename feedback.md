## Code Comments:

Please take a look at my inline code comments for specific notes on your code.

## Deployment:

> Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

**2: Performing.** The deployed app seems to be working just like the local one!

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**1: Progressing.** Good start here. I would really have liked to see you create a trivia game that makes heavier use of DOM manipulation, especially in reaction to user events. For example, display one question on the page at a time with potential answer choices or an input field. You would then cause a different question to show when the user clicks "Next" or something like that. I think you can do that while still incorporating your cool trivia-meets-hangman theme. It would all make more a much better user experience.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

**2: Performing.** Had no issues reading through your code. I do think there are some good opportunities for refactoring both in your Javascript and CSS. Please take a look at my code comments for more info.

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**2: Performing.** Dig your hangman-meets-trivia idea. Nice unique spin on the project prompts. With more DOM manipulation (see my earlier notes as well as my code comments), I think you can bring this theme even more to life.
