# GA--Project-1
Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Technologies:
MacbookPro
HTML
CSS
Javascript
JQuery

Approach Taken:
I decided to separate the stick man into 6 pieces that are put into div's (head,left arm, right arm, etc.). Then hide each piece from the user. Then the user will be asked a function(question). The user then has 2 choices to choose from. If the question is answered correctly, then the next function(question) will be executed. If the user gets the answer wrong, then a piece of the man will be revealed to the user, and the next question will be asked.

Instructions: Answer the questions with either a 1 or 2 until you are prompted to check your results. If you see the entire stick man on the screen (6 pieces total) then you have lost. If not then you've won.

Unsolved problems:
The stick man isn't showing up each time you get the answer wrong. The results only show up at the end.
